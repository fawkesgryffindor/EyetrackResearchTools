SETUP ON A NEW SYSTEM
Follow steps in KinectStuffForVarsha/read_1st_README.txt
Download Mingw and install
Follow steps below on openni with mingw
Download freeglut and unzip it
Copy freeglut.dll to C:\windows\syswow64
Download eyetrack repo from https://github.com/bdol/eyetrack

OPENNI WITH MINGW
http://qtkinectwrapper.googlecode.com/svn/!svn/bc/14/trunk/doc/openni_include_patch_notes.txt
(copied here)
In order to use OpenNI with mingw under windows, the platform file must be changed:
- so that the "linux" variant of include is called
- yet that the __stdcall calling convention is used.

These following must be changed:

1) Change XnPlatform.h: <openni install directory>/include


#if defined(__MINGW32__) // gcc-windows
   #include "mingw-win32/XnPlatformLinux-x86.h"
#elif (_WIN32) // Microsoft Visual Studio

2) Copy Include/Linux-x86 to Include/mingw-win32

3) Change XnPlatformLinux-x86.h:

// Changed callback type for gcc-windows (mingw) compiles to include the stdcall decoration:
#define XN_CALLBACK_TYPE XN_STDCALL



PYTHON INSTALL (http://luugiathuy.com/2011/02/setup-opencv-for-python/)

Download and install OpenCV 2.3 from http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/. Note that this version only supports Python 2.6
Add “C:/Python2.7;C:/OpenCV2.2/bin” to PATH variable (You need to change the directory to where you install Python and OpenCV).
Create PYTHONPATH variable and put “C:/OpenCV2.2/Python2.7/Lib/site-packages” as value.
For OpenCV2.3, There are two other options for this step:
copy the content of folder “C:\opencv\build\python\2.7” (for opencv 2.2: C:/OpenCV2.2/Python2.7/Lib/site-packages) to folder “C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages“


COMPILE OPENNI C++ CODE AND RUN
eclipse
mingw

Create a new c++ project on eclipse and copy the contents of NISimpleViewer.cpp from the open ni samples
copy <OPENNI_INSTALL_DIR>/Data into current project diretory
Copy <OPENNI_INSTALL_DIR>/Samples/NiSimpleViewer/GL into current project diretory
Copy <OPENNI_INSTALL_DIR>/Samples/NiSimpleViewer/glh into current project diretory
Copy <OPENNI_INSTALL_DIR>/Samples/NiSimpleViewer/Libs into current project diretory
right click on project, c/c++ build -> settings -> gcc c++ compiler -> includes
Include paths: open environment variables add copy OPEN_NI_INCLUDES variable contents here
		put in current project directory's path
MinGW C++ Linker->Libraries
Libraries: OpenNI
	freeglut
	glut32
	glu32
	opengl32
Library search path: open environment variables add copy OPEN_NI_LIBS variable contents here
			path_to_freeglut\lib
			The Libs folder copied into current directory from <OPENNI_INSTALL_DIR>/Samples/NiSimpleViewer/Libs
			<OPENNI_INSTALL_DIR>/Samples/Bin/Release

Thats it!
Build the project
And Run the exe
