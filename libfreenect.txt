Follow those on the openkinect website.
Instead of glut, download freeglut for windows.
copy the glut.h file into the include/GL folder of your mingw setup.
everything else remains the same
Also, when it asks to copy dlls and libraries to c:/windows/system32, copy them instead to c:/windows/syswow64

After using cmake to generate the makefile, open up a cmd prompt and navigate to the build folder you selected in cmake as the detsination. and run 
mingw32-make
